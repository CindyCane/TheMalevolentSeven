# The Malevolent Seven

Cowboy Game Made with JavaScript/jQuery and Firebase

## The Rules

During a quick draw duel, the player must rest their mouse on the cylinder to begin the duel. When the player hears a bell and sees a target appear, quickly click on the target to shoot the enemy while the enemy does the same. Clicking the bullseye deals 100 damage while clicking on the middle white ring deals 50 damage and the outer red ring deals 25 damage. The player only has six rounds in their revolver therefore, if the player has used all six rounds, the player cannot fire anymore. Whoever delivers 100 damage to their enemy wins to fight another day.
